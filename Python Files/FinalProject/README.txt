Run helper.py first, then servers, then clients.
Commands need to be typed using shortcuts:
1. moneyTransfer(amount, client1, client2): fromClient toClient amount
2. printBlockchain: pbc
3. printBalance: pb
4. printSet: ps
Our project uses a feature from python 3.7, while csil only supports up to 3.6.8.
So we have to run the demo on our own computer. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Data persistence is implemented.
